# Skybolt Engine
Skybolt is a real-time planetary environment rendering engine, designed for flight simulators, aerospace R&D, and geospatial applications. Skybolt is written in C++, based on OpenSceneGraph, and supports CIGI for communicating with host applications. Skybolt also features a Python API for easy integration with science and engineering research tools.

The Skybolt repository includes Sprocket, a GUI application for creating scenarios and visualizing data. Sprocket supports python scripting and node-based graphical programming.

controller.setTarget(earth)
controller.selectController("Globe")

sb.stepOnceAndRenderUntilDone(engine, window, 0.1)
```

## Building
Use CMake to configure and generate a build. Optional projects within the repository can be enabled/disabled with CMake BUILD_xxx properties as desired.

## Installing Asset Packages
At runtime, Skybolt uses assets such as meshes, textures, and shaders. These assets are organized into packages. Each package is a folder containing a hierarchy of asset files on disk.

Skybolt searches for asset packages in these locations:
1. <CurrentWorkingDirectory>/Assets
2. Paths in the SKYBOLT_ASSETS_PATH environment variable

To run Skybolt, you must ensure the required packages are avilable to Skybolt using either of the above mechanisms.

### Core Package (Required)
Skybolt cannot run without the Core package. It is located under /Assets in this repository.

### SkyboltAssets Packages (Required for Example Applications)
Additional packages for running the example applications are located in the [SkyboltAssets](https://github.com/Piraxus/SkyboltAssets) repository. SkyboltAssets uses [DVC](https://dvc.org) for remote storage and retrieval of large files which are not stored in the git repository itself.

To checkout the SktboltAssets repository:
1. If you do not already have DVC installed, run `pip install dvc[s3]` to install with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip)
2. Clone [SkyboltAssets](https://github.com/Piraxus/SkyboltAssets) and checkout desired git branch/tag
3. Run `dvc pull` command in the SkyboltAssets root directory to fetch the remote files

### NLCD Land Cover (Optional)
Land cover tiles for USA. Used by Skybolt to place trees on terrain in forest areas. This package can be downloaded [here](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/skybolt/NLCDLandCover_1_0_0.zip).

### Seattle Map Features (Optional)
Map features (buildings, roads, lakes etc) for the city of Seattle. These features were generated from OpenStreetMap data using the MapFeaturesConverter tool. This package can be downloaded [here](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/skybolt/Seattle_1_1_0.zip).

## Running
### Settings
Engine settings are stored in a json file, which may be manually edited with a text editor, or edited in Sprocket with the Tools->Settings dialog.
An example settings file template is available in this repository under src/SkyboltExamples/ExamplesCommon/ExampleSettings.json.

The settings file can be loaded by example applications with the --settingsFile commandline option. If the option is not specified, a default Settings.json in the Operating System user's home directory will be used. On windows, this is located at C:/Users/<Username>/AppData/Local/Skybolt/Settings.json.

### Using third party Map APIs
By default, the PlanetEarth entity uses mapbox for albedo and elevation data. To use mapbox, you must acquire an API key from https://mapbox.com
Without an API key, the tiles will not download, the the planet will not render correctly. If desired, PlanetEarth can be edited to use Bing maps for albedo instead. A bing key can be obtained from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key
Keys are stored in the engine json settings file (see above).
