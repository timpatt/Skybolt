# Skybolt Engine
A C++/Python-based engine for simulating and visualizing dynamic objects such as aircraft, ships and spacecraft, in a 3D planetary environment.

## Features
* **Dynamic Simulation:** Real-time 3D object simulation within a geospatial coordinate system.
* **Modular Architecture**: Model dynamic objects using a composition-based entity-component system (ECS) with a configurable property framework.
* **Photoreal Rendering**: Visualize photorealistic environments, including terrain, ocean, urban infrastructure, and atmospheric conditions.
* **Extensible Framework**: Add custom functionality through C++ and Python-based plugins. 
* **Scenario Viewer App**: Interactive 3D application for visualizing scenarios.

# Add local repositories

conan remote add archon-conan ./Conan # In Archon directory

# Don't do this for now - this builds and installs the package into the conan cache; too slow for development work
uv run conan create . -s build_type=RelWithDebInfo # First in skybolt directory, then in Archon directory
# Use this one instead - this builds the package into the 'build' directory
cd Skybolt
  uv run conan build . -s build_type=RelWithDebInfo --build=missing
  conan editable add .
cd ../Archon
  uv run conan build . -s build_type=RelWithDebInfo --build=missing

Then run ./ArchonApp

# That's it... Ignore the rest.

NOTE: To run Archon (and qt), you need to have install the following (if it isn't already there):
`sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0`

Qt tells you this is required during launch with the error `From 6.5.0, xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0 is needed to load the Qt xcb platform plugin.`

# TODO
* Tests don't work because build context doesn't contain paths to conan dependencies
  * Add DISCOVERY_MODE PRE_TEST to catch_discover_tests to run it in host context just before tests are run.
	* See https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/2493
* Backup conan dependency sources somewhere (see https://docs.conan.io/2/devops/backup_sources/sources_backup.html)
* Remove `include_package` functionality from conanfile and replace with https://docs.conan.io/2/devops/devops_local_recipes_index.html (potentially)
* Add top-level submodule to capture child packages
* Allow assets to sit in sibling directories
* .gitattributes in SkyboltUnreal is broken.  Need to update and rewrite history
* *.ttf files checked into skybolt need to be added to lfs.  Also remove fonts that we don't have a license for
* "package" now fails in Skybolt; fix it up
* Build UnrealEngine and SkyboltUnrealEngine (with RTTI enabled) and fix any issues
* Assets/Core/Shaders are referred to from SkyboltVisTests/PrincipledBrdfTests.cpp.  Anything required for build should be in the source (?)
* The `MinimalApp` example is way too large!!  It even requires an extra library "ExamplesCommon" to build!?!?
  * I want to be able to do "MinimalApp myApp"; it should be configured with sane defaults, and still be able to configure it as required
* libFftOcean.so can't be loaded in Archon for some reason
* Need to fix this code; it results in a message "std::exception" rather than e.what(): ```
	// Catch and re-throw a copy of the exception to avoid issues with exceptions crossing shared library boundaries
		throw std::exception(e);```
* On Linux, plugins are in the lib/plugins directory, not bin/plugins... EngineRootFactory::getDefaultPluginDirs needs to be updated
* In EngineRoot::EngineRoot, the children of each asset path are registered as asset packages; which means `<AssetPath/Icon>` is added as a path, leading to a bunch of errors like `Could not locate file: Icons/google/settings.svg`; Icons has already been sucked up into the search path...
* Top level source directories need renaming; either make Skybolt the top level source directory and use `#include <Skybolt/App/whatever.hpp>` or use the next level down and prefix *everything* with Skybolt (which is kind of what is there).  That goes for things like AircraftHud and TileMapGenerator, too (unless they're apps in which case they should not be in the Skybolt directory).  Same for Archon - there should NOT be a top-level "Plugins" directory because this is a global namespace and is bound to conflict at some point (assuming you're able to refer to the plugin from another plugin - which it seems that we are!?)
